# Packed-Food-Fact

Iâ€™m part of a 6-member team working on Packed-Food Fact, a Capstone Project at IIT Patna during our first year of college. Our project is all about building a website that informs and educates people about the impact of packaged and processed foods. My role is to design the website, focusing on the HTML and CSS aspects to make it user-friendly and visually appealing. Our main goal is to promote food literacy and help people make smarter, healthier choices by improving their awareness through our platform.
